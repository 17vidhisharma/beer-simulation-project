# üç∫ Craft Beer Business Simulation  

A data-driven business simulation project completed for **AD715: Quantitative & Qualitative Decision-Making** at Boston University (Spring 2025).  
Our team designed a **craft beer bar and microbrewery in Austin, Texas**, running multiple simulation cycles to optimize **operations, finance, HR, and innovation strategies**.  

The result? A microbrewery concept that *breaks even in just 9 months* and pours $4.3M median profit over 36 months.
